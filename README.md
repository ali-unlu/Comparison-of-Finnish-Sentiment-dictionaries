# Comparison of Finnish Sentiment Dictionaries 

The post aims to show the performance of different sentiment dictioanaries in Finnish Language. To illustrate it, here I used twitter data. The case is the Green Party's proposal for cannabis legalization. 

Analysis includes:
1. Tweeter sentiment analysis, based on word frequency and weighted scores
2. Unit of analysis is per tweet, instead of basic word frequency 
3. Quenteda package 
4. Discussion of dictionary performance
.
